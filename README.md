# Demo Project README

This is a simple readme file.

## Heading 2

I hope this isn't much of a problem.

### Branches

A branch is a label applied to a timeline range of changes.

 * Fast forward: No changes in the parent branch
 * Automatic: Non-conflicting changes in the parent branch
 * Manual: Requires manual conflict resolution

### Special Markers

Like Pointers. HEAD is a special pointer that refers to the last commit on the current branch.

### Extra Updates

... on our "updates" branch.
